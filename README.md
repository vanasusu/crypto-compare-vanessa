# Crypto Compare Chart
<b>Summary</b><br>
Recently there has been many talks in the news on Crypto market crashes such as Bitcoin's values falling more than half its value since it's peak in Nov 2021, Terra(Luna) crypto network collapsed that wiped out $60 billion in the digital currency space.
Investors can benefit from my site by monitoring the trends and changes in price to stay abreast in this volatile market.

Crypto Compare allows teh user to easily see the price, 24h volume and change percentage. The user is able to easily select their viewing method by bar, candle stick or map. Thye can also toggle between various indicatiors.

As the main motive of this project is for the user to navigate crypto price changes, I have included bar, line and pie chart to compare the % change in price.
